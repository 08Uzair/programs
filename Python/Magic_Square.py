                                                    üìù Introduction:
‚Ä¢ A magic square is a square grid of numbers where each row, column, and diagonal add up to the same total.
‚Ä¢ Find the "magic constant" sum of each row, column, and diagonal with S = n[(n^2 + 1)/2] where n is the number of squares in each row.
‚Ä¢ Use a solving technique based on the size of the magic square and how many boxes are in each row or column.

                                                    üß© Steps:
1) In any magic square, 1 is located at position (n/2, n-1).
2) Let's say the position of 1 i.e. (n/2, n-1) is (p, q), then next number which is 2 is located at (p-1, q+l) position.
    Anytime if the calculated row position becomes -1 then make it n-1 and if column position becomes n then make it O.
3) If the calculated position already contains a number then decrement the column by 2 and increment the row by 1.
4) If anytime row position becomes -1 and column becomes n, switch it to (O, n-2).
